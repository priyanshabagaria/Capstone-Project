# Capstone-Project
Business Objective
Build a restaurant Success model for New York. I decided to create a model that can help restaurant lenders (such as banks) and investors decide whether they should lend/invest at a particular restaurant based on the likelihood that it is going to fail within the next few years.Once a customer approaches the bank with his business proposal my model can help the bank predict the star rating of the restaurant. If the rating is above 3.5 it is safe to invest or else the bank can ask the customer to make changes to his proposal and come back.
